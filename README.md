# Emulators

JavaScript Projects from various authors, I apologize for not listing their names yet.

This project demonstrates several methods of computing and lower level process management for a higher level system.

It's construction is intended to be learning material or as an environment to experiment.

## Deprecated API

- webkitfilesystem

I have not experienced issues with this API so it's not my place to say why It's deprecated, but it shouldn't be used in the wild.

For lack of a better storage quota on the legacy device I enjoy programming with, It remains part of this project.
